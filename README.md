Man, I just walked out of Uppercut and my brain’s still fizzing like a soda left in the sun. The theater was noisy, I could barely hear half the damn dialogue—people chomping on popcorn like they were feeding the birds. It’s got me thinking, what was that ending even about? It’s like an accordion got smashed into a screenplay, and not in a bad way, just... unpredictable.

There’s one scene where the guy, Tom? Tony? Whatever—he’s swinging in this epic slo-mo, like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 your coffee spill in the morning but you’re too tired to care. My back’s killing me from these uncomfortable seats, and all I could think about was how that one punch felt like getting your chair kicked by a kid in a flight. BOOM, right to the feels and the neck pain.

>suddenly I'm wondering if I 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the   could i pick up on all those weird subplots.. like, why did the chimpanzee have an eyepatch? I get it, metaphor or some artsy nonsense but I was half-expecting it to start speaking Italian. Who wrote this, a circus?

The soundtrack—oh man—you know that screech sound you get when you step on a Lego barefoot? That was the violin, sharp and unforgiving, crawling under your skin until you’re raw. I was half in the mood to just roll under my seat and let the popcorn crumbs rain down like confetti while it played.

Someone told me to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   ‘cause it’s got layers. LAYERS!?! More like an onion that makes you cry for all the wrong reasons, or maybe the right ones? This review’s a mess, just like my thoughts right now. I should’ve sent a voice note.

I remember the lighting too—like they got a child to play with the dimmer switch. Every time I blinked it felt like a whole new scene and I’m not even sure what’s real anymore... matrix-style without Keanu's cool factor. If I could just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the essence of the chaos, I’d be a smarter man, perhaps.
